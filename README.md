## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- jQuery

### What I learned

I put in practice the knowledge I had about js and jquery in this project. I messed up with the classes (adding, removing and toggling), selected elements (manipulating the DOM) and got the content (text/html) of those elements.
